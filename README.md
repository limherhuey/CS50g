# CS50's Introduction to Game Development
> This course picks up where CS50x leaves off, focusing on the development of 2D and 3D interactive games. Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Portal in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as languages like Lua and C#. 

This repository contains my solutions to the course's 11 projects as well as the CS50x 2020 games track projects. All projects pass all requirements as of 2020.

### CS50x 2020 Games Track
I place this here so as not to clog [my CS50x repo](https://github.com/limherhuey/CS50x-2020), because the 2021 (and most likely, onwards) version of CS50x does not have the Game Development track.

* [PSet8: Games Track](CS50x_games_track/) - [problem description](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/games/)
    - [Pong](CS50x_games_track/pong/)
    - [Mario](CS50x_games_track/mario/)
